Description
====================

REST API to manage customer data for a small shop. It will work as the backend side for a CRM interface. 

API requirements:

- The API should be only accessible by a registered user by providing an authentication mechanism.
- A user can only:
  - List all customers in the database
  - Get full customer information, including a photo URL
  - Create a new customer
  - A customer should have at least name, surname, id and a photo field
  - Name, surname and id are required fields
  - Image uploads should be able to be managed
  - The customer should have a reference to the user who created it
  - Update an existing customer
  - The customer should hold a reference to the last user who modified it
  - Delete an existing customer
- An admin can also:
  - Manage users
  - Create users
  - Delete users
  - Update users
  - List users
  - Change admin status




Usage
============================

Installation
----------------

This project was created with docker, to learn more about docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started You should
have little problem starting it up in whatever environment you code in. 

```bash
cd yourProjectFolder
git clone https://bitbucket.org/Chayemor/cmr_service.git
```

With this step done you have successfully cloned the repo. Now before running with docker-compose it's 
important to set up the .env variables that docker needs.

Set up
-----------------

There's a file with the name .env_template, copy the file and rename to .env and fill out with desired 
data or leave example data. It's the names of the variables in there that are important, the actual values you write are not.

```bash
cd cmr_service
cp .env_template .env
```

The variable names are self explanatory to their function. I will only mention these ones:

**DJANGO_SU_EMAIL**
**DJANGO_SU_PASSWORD**

You should remember the values you place for these since this is your admin user. It is the only
user that will be created in the DB once you run the project for the first time. It's your access to create new
Users and set their status to admin. 

Run
-----------------

Assuming you are in the repository folder, all that's left to do is build the docker container, then run it.
 
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose run
```

That's it. The API should now be available at **localhost:8000/api/v1/docs**

Running Tests
============================

To run tests you must be inside the running container labeled **cmr_service**. 

Common Docker commands
============================

## View running containers 

```bash
docker ps
```
```bash 
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
115f46c7f03e        cmr_service_web                  "bash /entrypoint.sh"    2 hours ago         Up 2 hours          0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   cmr_service
603f6d1c9db7        postgres:9.6                     "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   4 days ago          Up 2 hours          0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   cmr_service_postgres_1
```

You should get something like this. The last column, **NAMES** are the names of the running containers. If you ever want to log into one, you need that name. The 
**cmr_service** contains the actual code for the API, while the **cmr_service_postgres_1** is the container that holds the database itself. If you want to be
able to log into Postgres, you'd log into that container, and not **cmr_service**.

## Log into a docker container

```bash
docker exec -it docker_container_name bash
```

Example: **cmr_service**

```bash
docker exec -it cmr_service bash
```

Once logged in, if you do a simple ```ls``` you'd see the following:

```bash
root@115f46c7f03e:/django-docker# ls
Dockerfile  README.md  cmr_service  customers  db_init	docker-compose.yml  entrypoint-dev.sh  entrypoint-prod.sh  manage.py  media  requirements  users  wait-for-it.sh
```

## Start a container without a rebuild
Assuming you are in the same path as 

```bash
docker-compose up
```
